# INTRODUCTION

- LEDs are small, powerful lights that are used in many different applications. To start, we will work on blinking an LED, the Hello World of microcontrollers. It is as simple as turning a light on and off.

# SWOT ANALYSIS

## STRENGTH

- A decade back, who would have thought that technology will enable controlling light bulbs with the help of a smartphone. 
- Using LED smart lighting technology, bulbs can connect to a smart device using wireless technology.
- Since LEDs use only a fraction of the energy of an incandescent light bulb there is a dramatic decrease in power costs

## WEEKNESS
- Overheating can cause reduced lamp life.
- Since this technology is relatively new, not a lot of people are aware of these bulbs

## OPPURTUNITY
- Scope of  attract corporate clients be high.

## TREADS
- The lighting industry is characterized by cut-throat competition
- Performance standardization has not yet been streamlined

# 4W & 1H

## WHY
- It can be used in operation theaters or offices as an indication that you are engaged in work

## WHO 
- buyers may choose to go with the traditional options available.

## WHAT
- LEDs are small, powerful lights that are used in many different applications
- It's a simple electronic circuit that gives you a visual cue if it works.The goal is to make a Light Emitting Diode (LED) blink

## WHEN
- A decade back, who would have thought that technology will enable controlling light bulbs 

## HOW
- The Blinking LED is a passive device that converts the light energy into an electrical signal output

# REQUIREMENTS

## HIGH LEVEL REQUIREMENTS
