# INTRODUCTION

- The LED BLINKING using ATMEGA328P AVR micrcontroller,the lights are some of the most popular bulbs used today. The blinking light is simply a light that goes on and off in a specific pattern. The pattern can be fast or slow and the lights can be a solid color or a variety of different colors.

# SWOT ANALYSIS

## STRENGTH
 - Gives the user complete control over the lighting system, reduced electricity consumption , and increased sustainbility
 - LED smart lighting technology, bulbs can connect to a smart device using wireless technology.
 
 ## WEEKNESS
 - Overheating can cause reduced lamp life
 
 ## OPPURTUNITY
 - scope of attracting corporate clients are high.
 - Safety will also improve because unsafe situation will be easily predicted.
 
 ## TREATS
 - The major barrier is the complications involved in the setup and usage of smart bulbs

# 4W & 1H

## WHAT
- The pattern can be fast or slow and the lights can be a solid color or a variety of different colors.
- The LED is the abbreviation of light emitting diode.

## WHO
- you can make one using components like an inverter,  microcontroller.

## WHY
- It can be used in operation theaters or offices as an indication that you are engaged in work.

## WHEN
- When electrical loads turn on and off in your home, this creates a change in voltage levels.
- which may cause the LED lights to occasionally dim or flicker.

## HOW
- LED blinking circuit can be used as flashing beacon.
- The Blinking LED is a passive device that converts the light energy into an electrical signal output
